# Overview

This data set is a compilation of birth names given in and around the 20th century. I got this data set from my school, BYU-Idaho.

You can find it here, if you like: [Linky Link](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv)

The purpose of this analysis is to practice graph making with altair, and data analysis with pandas.

# Data Analysis Results

1. How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?

* Depends on what state you're in, but overall it seems like the name Richard is on the decline. Understandable, truthfully.

2. If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of their age? What ages would you not guess?

* I would guess that they are about my age, and I would be about right. Unlike the name Tiffany, of course, which dates to B.C. Roman times. An interesting note.

3. Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names.

* Not a question, but this is an important analysis. Biblical names, at least the main ones listed, are on the decline.

4. Think of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot that name and see how increases line up with the movie release.

* I didn't find any data supporting the idea that Hermione, Harry, or Ron increased with the release of the Harry Potter movies, which shocked me. That said, I found that the name 'Ariel' did increase with the release of the Little Mermaid.

# Development Environment

This was all made in either VSCode or Google Colab (where I started before I moved it over to VSCode). The libraries used were pandas and altair. Seaborn is a good substitute, if that's what you're into.

# Future Work

* More analysis with other Biblical names
* Finding other datasets to improve the robustness of the analysis
